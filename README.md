# Dino Bank | Money Mojo

Submitted for RE2012 Solution Project by ReDesign Team 5.

## Background

Money is widely used in our daily transactions and it is an important functional skill for independent living. There are 3 associated challenges when it comes to handling coins:
 * Identification of Coins and Notes
 * Manipulating money- addition and subtraction
 
 There is also a lack in appropriate market solutions to address this problem.
  * Toy Cashiers: While they incorporate money into play, they are limited to fake currency which limits transferability.
  * Coin Banks: They teach important concepts of saving but they are restricted to only coins.
  * Educational Apps: They gamify the learning experience and provides contextualised scenarios but they lack realism due to virtual currency.
  
 Thus, ReDesign Team 5 has decided to address this identified problem statement.


## Overview
Featuring a two-in-one solution, Dino Bank. It comprises of a software web application, Money Mojo that is partnered with a hardware toy, Dino Bank.
